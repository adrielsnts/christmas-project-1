            <h2>MOM</h2>
            <p>
Having a compassionate mom like you while growing up was a true blessing and the greatest gift anyone could ever have given me. It’s Christmas – the season of love, and it reminds me of your ever growing love and the memorable Christmas seasons that I have spend with you. This letter is not enough to thank you for all your support and encouragement through the various phases of life. It is because of the self confidence and priceless values that you instilled in me that made me who I am today. The memories based on your surprise Christmas party for my friend and your lovely gifts always bring tears to my eyes.Thank you so very much for being so wonderful mom. May this Christmas fill your life with unlimited happiness!</p>

            <h2>DAD</h2>
            <p>The loss of you made me strong. I became an independent young man who wanted to do it all on his own. I love that I became strong, but I hate that I had to lose you to do it. I hope and pray my children become strong. I hope and pray they don’t have to lose me to become that way. I will mold them. Give them tasks to make them strong. I don’t want to leave them to strengthen them. There must be another way. I often pray that you are able to know some of my joys. I hope you can know some small piece of my life. You missed it all, but I’m hoping someday I will see you and you will tell me you were there with me. You will tell me you sat in the church and watched me marry my wife. I hope you will tell me you were able to see my sons faces when they burst into this world. Thank you Dad. I love you.</p>

            <p>Thank you for making me brave.You always brought out the adventurous side in me. Whether it was pressuring me to take off my bike’s training wheels or inviting me to play manhunt with the big kids, I was a brave little one because of you. You opened my eyes to the scariest of movies, (which still scar me to this day.</p> <p>Thank you for getting on my nerves. The teasing was endless, and I’m confident you’ll still pick on me even in our old age. But I really owe you for being such a pain. Without you constantly getting under my skin, I wouldn’t be as strong as I am today. "Don’t give him a reaction!" Mom would say. Yeah -- easier said than done. But at the end of the day, I have you to thank for my thick skin. I bet you thought you’d never hear me say it, but thank you for being a little jerk.Thank you for everything, Kuya Ali</p>

            <h2>KUYA BO</h2>
            <p>I want to first off thank you for being my life long playmate and best friend. Even when I ripped every toy you had apart and busted your favorite things, you returned to me hours later with a smile. When mommy would put me in time out, you'd defend me and blame yourself to get me out of trouble. You've taken up for me when I was wrong and never questioned me over anything you know I wouldn't do. From the time I've been a kid till now, you've kept me safe, you've kept me close. Without your guidance through my earliest years in this hateful world, i'm afraid I would not be who I am.Thank you for reminding me always that I matter. You've always been able to tell if there is something wrong and bring me back into my happiest place. Whether it be from teasing me till I pee or making funny faces till I crack a smile, you've always found a way. You bring me back down a level of understanding when I do not see things clearly. You've also reminded me in times, that I am not the only one that matters. you've kept me straight and given me a reality check when I needed it most. You've given me hope in your goofy ways, when I feel that there is no hope left. You've always seen the bigger picture. And for that, I thank you so much for being my partner-in-crime, Kuya Bo.</p>
